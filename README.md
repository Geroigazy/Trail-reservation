# Trail-reservation
My java OOP endterm project about trali ticket reservation 

When the program is switched on, the selection menu appears.
If you choose to start, the flight search program is activated. Then it asks a starting city, then finish city, after date of depature.
After this it display flight then you choose it, after it asks you to enter data about youself and save it on dbms
In DBMS I have to table one for customers data and another for flights and there are only 10 flights in this table so far, but I think this is enough to test the efficiency of the methods.

In the Validator class, we check the correctness and acceptability of the buyer's data
In the App class, the operation methods of this project like: Searching and return tickets, and customer registration
